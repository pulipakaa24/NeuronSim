# NeuronSim

## Setup

If you'd like to run the flask app on your own machine, download a zip of this repo, then unzip, start a terminal in the unzipped folder, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run `python sim.py` This was tested on python 3.11, but it should ideally work on future versions as well.
